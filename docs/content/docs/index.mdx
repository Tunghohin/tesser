description: Understand the goals of the Tesser trading framework and how the pieces fit together.
---

Tesser is a Rust-native trading framework that bundles everything required to run systematic strategies.

- **CLI** – orchestrates data downloads, backtests, live sessions, and persistence.
- **Strategy SDK** – traits, macros, and helper crates so you can focus on signals, not plumbing.
- **Execution + Portfolio** – risk-aware order routing, PnL tracking, drawdown guardrails, and alerting.

The documentation is served from [`tesser.space/docs`](https://tesser.space/docs) in production.

## Architecture

| Component | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `tesser-cli` | User-facing interface for running backtests and live sessions. |
| `tesser` facade | Re-exports the ecosystem and provides `run_cli()` so your own crate can host the CLI. |
| `tesser-strategy` | Strategy traits, context helpers, and built-in reference bots. |
| Connectors | Exchange adapters (Bybit, Paper, etc.) that plug into the orchestrator. |

## Durable Live Trading

- Strategies persist custom state through `snapshot()` / `restore()`.
- Live runtime snapshots portfolio state, open orders, and strategy blobs to SQLite.
- Alerting hooks ensure drawdowns or connectivity issues raise notifications immediately.

```bash
# Inspect registered strategies
cargo run --bin tesser-cli -- strategies

# Start a live session from the CLI
tesser -- live run --strategy-config config/strategies/example.toml
```
